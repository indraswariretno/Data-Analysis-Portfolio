1. Credit Risk Analysis
**Goal**  
Analyze default rates across different **age groups** and **income groups** to identify high-risk customer segments.  

**Key Insights**  
- Senior customers (>60 years) show the highest default rate, despite being the smallest group by count.  
- Low-income customers (<30k) have the highest default rate (47%), while high-income customers (>100k) have the lowest.

 2. HR Employee Attrition Analysis
**Goal**  
Examine attrition rates based on **age group**, **income group**, and **gender**.  

**Key Insights**

3. Superstore Sales Analysis
**Goal**  
Analyze sales performance by **region**, **state**, and **product category**, and evaluate the relationship between **shipment time** and **profitability**.  

**Key Insights**  
- Copiers are the most profitable items, while tables generate the largest losses.  
- New York has the highest sales and profit, while Texas records the lowest (negative profit).  
- Average shipment times:  
  - First Class: 2 days  
  - Same Day: 0 days  
  - Second Class & Standard Class: 4 days  
- Standard Class shipments generate the highest profit, indicating faster delivery modes do not necessarily increase profitability.
